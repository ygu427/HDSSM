Description: A high-dimensional linear State Space Model(SSM) with a new Expectation-Regularization-Maximization(ERM) algorithm to construct the dynamic Gene Regularization Network(GRN). The new ERM algorithm employs the idea of the adaptive LASSO-based variable selection method to preserve the sparsity property of GRN.
